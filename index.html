<h3>Bodyguards</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li>Group of 8.</li>
<li>They didn't check-in at any attraction and they walk the same path every day, as shown in image (1.1).</li>
<li>Only one group.</li>
<li>Every day they start walking at 8:45 from the right entrance and they get to Grinosaurus Stage at 9:30. At 11:30 they return back to the entrance of the park, where they arrive at 12:15.  They repeat the same process at 13:45 to 14:30 and at 16:30 to 17:15. On Sunday, they don’t make the second walk (13:45 to 14:30 and 16:30 to 17:15).</li>
<li>This group corresponds to Scott Jones' bodyguards or Scott’s entourage.</li>
<li>Placing the stage nearer to the Entrance or providing a vehicle to reduce the walking time (45 minutes).</li></ol>

		<p><i>Made in Tableau. This image shows this group movement in the park. Everyday the same path from the entrance to Grinosaurus Stage and all the way back.</i></p>

</div>

<h3>Burglars</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li>Group of 48. (See Creighton Pavilion in graphic (1.2) )</li>
<li>They visit Creighton Pavilion on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, where the medals are robbed.</li>
<li>Only one group.</li>
<li>On Sunday, they are at Creighton Pavilion between 11 and 13. According to our observations, the crime was around 12.</li>
<li>This group is considered the principal suspicious beacause they are at the crime scene and in the time when the crime happens, and also because they enter the exhibition everyday.</li>
<li>It's weird to attend 3 days to the same exhibition. Guards should have noticed this behaviour. Normally, no one attends to the same exhibition three times in a row unless something is planning...</li>
</ol>

<h3>Big Tour Groups</h3>
<ol type="a">

<li>Several groups consisting of 30 - 45 members each.</li>
<li>Each group moves consistently together, although there is no relation between the activity each group goes.</li>
<li>At least 4 of this groups per day</li>
<li>They follow a time frame, each group checks in at different games but, they seem to check-in at the same time. They access the park between 9:00 - 9:30 and they do not re-visit the park.</li>
<li>We can infer that they have a prepared schedule, and are all related to the same tour company.</li>
<li>The park should provide ways to make the group move more efficiently through the park.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Addicts</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li>Group of 296.</li>
<li>They go to the attractions shown in image (1.4)</li>
<li>Only one group.</li>
<li>Each of them went more than 10 times to the same attraction.</li>
<li>They are the “addicts” of DinoFun World!</li>
<li>Provide more attractions of the same category as these ones.</li>

<li>Only one group.</li>
<li>They like to go to Thrill Rides and Rides for Everyone (more density in this spots in image (1.5) ).</li>
<li>This group goes to the park because they like attractions and games but not because the park was doing the special event to commemorate Scott Jones.</li>
<li>Make alternative shows or bringing other sports’ ex-players the crowd may be interested meeting or attending to their show.</li></ol>

<h3>Wakey-wakey </h3>
<ol type="a">
<li>Group of around 2000.</li>
<li>They love to go to as many attractions as possible, most of them enter the park at 8 and leave at 23.</li>
<li>3 different groups, each of them at one different entrance.</li>
<li>This group likes to get to the park between 8 and 9 am so as to make the most of their day at the park. (See graphic 1.6)</li>
<li>They like to enjoy the whole day in the park so as to go to every attraction they can, as many times as possible.</li>
<li>The park could open earlier, it would be expected that the waky waky group would like to get in the park even earlier.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Sleepy </h3>
<ol type="a">
<li>Less than 60.</li>
<li>They can’t get into many attractions because it’s late.</li>
<li>3 different groups. Each one on a different entrance.  </li>
<li>This group enter the park between 18 and 20, that is almost when the park closes. (See graphic 1.6)</li>
<li>They don’t like losing time on queues, that’s why they arrive when everybody is leaving.</li>
<li>Close the park later.</li>

<h3>TweetBots</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li>Group of 2 (ids 1278894 - 839736).</li>

<li>It is a very rare group, only 2 in the whole park.</li>
<li>They are constantly sending and receiving messages. </li>

<h3>Inseparable</h3>
<ol type="a">
<li>Group from 2 to 2553 people.</li>

<li>Groups from 2 to 44 people decreasing frequency.</li>
<li>All members of one group might have been together because they entered at least 2 times at the same time to the same attractions.</li>

<div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">
<p align="justify">The first difference that is visible in (2.3) is the fact that the amount of movement and check-ins increased each day. 
According to (2.1), one notable difference is that on Friday the park apparently closed their doors earlier than the other two days. There is no pattern of checkins or movements in the park after 20 the first day while the other days people stay in the park up to 23.
The most visible differences in patterns of activity are related to the cancellation of Scott’s afternoon show on Sunday. This show (which is two hours long) takes place at 14:30 pm in Granusaurus Stage. Most people in the park went to see Jones and therefore the checkins and movements in the park were reduced until the show was over.  But as it can be observed in the visualizations, Sunday afternoon was the exception as the show was totally canceled. This fact permitted people to keep on moving through the park and the checkins rate remained stable and not facing a local minimum as it did happened on Friday and Saturday. 
It can also be observed that on Sunday from 16 the quantity of checkins is almost the same amount that on Saturday. This fact is peculiar as on Sunday much more people visited the park but it can be mentioned that the crimes may have scared many visitors and they left the park before it was planned.
One last thing to mention is that the amount of movement on Sunday between 11 to 14 was the highest of all weekend. Based on our predictions, the crime took place in that time zone, so this increment in movement may have been caused by the chaos that the robbery produced.

<h3>Closed Doors</h3>
<p>The park doors seem to be closed between 11:00 - 13:00 and 15:00 - 17:00. Although there are people checking-in at the doors during that times, they are not the first ones, so we can infer that they were already at the park and just happen to be at the location during that time.</p>

<h3>Crime Scene</h3>
<p>As shown in the image below, on Friday and Saturday the exhibition opens 3 times per day (8-9:30 / 11:30 - 14:30 / 16:30 - 20) having almost the same number of checking per hour. On Sunday (the day of the crime) the second exhibition closes at 12 instead of 14:30 and the third one never opens.</p>

</div>

<h3>Show cancelled</h3>
<p>On Friday and Saturday there are 2 programmed shows where Scott Jones appears, one of them in the morning (9:30 to 11:30) and the other one in the afternoon (14:30 to 16:30). Due to the fact that crimes have been taking place at the park, the afternoon show that was expected to take place at Grinosaurus Stage on Sunday was cancelled. This can be inferred in the graphic below because there are not checkins at the Stage after 10 am. </p>

<h3>Frightened Bodyguards</h3>
 <p>Every day they start walking at 8:45 from the right entrance and they get to Granusaurus Stage at 9:30. At 11:30 they return back to the entrance of the park, where they arrive at 12:15. They repeat the same process at 13:45 to 14:30 and at 16:30 to 17:15. On Sunday, they don’t make the second walk (13:45 to 14:30 and 16:30 to 17:15). This can be observed in the graphic below, which shows that the amount of movement on Sunday is more or less the 50% of the amount of movement on the other days.</p>

<h3>Suspicious guys</h3>
 <p>We’ve already included this group in the first part. This 48 guys attended the exhibition in Creighton Pavilion 3 times, that is, on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. We consider this a strange pattern because it’s not common to visit the same exhibition more than one time. Normally, one person sees the trophies and medals for one time and don’t come back to see them again, unless he is planning to do something (like a robbery). This persons could have been analyzing the place, the guards (that by the way are only a few, the park is hiring!) and the best moment to commit the crime.</p>
